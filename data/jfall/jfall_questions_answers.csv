the-ai-elections:-how-technology-could-shape-public-sentiment,0,"In the age of Deepfakes and Large Language Models (LLMs), the threat of misusing AI for shaping and manipulating public sentiment has reached unprecedented levels. In this talk, we shed light on the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and its potential implications for our societies.As pivotal elections in both the UK and USA loom in 2024, it is important to understand the evolving landscape of political influence, particularly in the digital realm. Remembering the impact of Cambridge Analytica‚Äôs manipulation during the Brexit era serves as a reminder of how information can be distorted to sway public opinion. In this keynote, we show the capabilities of modern AI and how they can be misused for shaping public opinion, using examples like Realtime Deepfakes and LLM-powered chatbots. Through a series of live demonstrations and showcases, we unveil the inner workings and technical foundation of these neural networks, highlight their capabilities and their weaknesses, and give an outlook on how we as a society can resist manipulation.In a",How can modern AI tools like Deepfakes and chatbots be misused to influence public opinion during elections?

help!-i-hate-my-teammate!,0,"Everybody now and then comes into a new team, or someone else comes into theirs. More often than not, cooperation does not go seamlessly straight away. Sometimes this evens out¬†by itself along the way. But in many occasions, it does not. Ways of working could be different. Something one values a lot, may not be valued at all by another, creating conflict. One may criticise or get criticised and things get uncomfortable. Teams may split into ""camps"" or one person just never agrees with the others. Team members may feel stepped over, pushed aside or misunderstood. If this goes on for too long, team members start to feel generally disrespected and demotivated. Then there are cases one member feels another is not qualified, or just a bully. This goes beyond forming and storming, this becomes a (team-wide) problem. In this session you will see you are not the only one experiencing these challenges.

We departed from the 'classic threads' station and traveled through Runnables, ExecutorServices, CompletableFutures and ForkJoinPools, before finally arriving at 'virtual threads'. But does 'finally' mean that we've arrived at our final destination, or is it a transfer at best?Now that virtual threads are available, our Java programs will likely use an abundance of threads. This increase in thread count will immediately make thread coordination, observability and isolation more difficult. Two new Java features are currently in development that might make things a bit easier: Structured Concurrency and Scoped Values.In this talk, we'll introduce and demonstrate these new features, and how they can help address the challenges that have emerged since the introduction of virtual threads. We'll also discuss how the availability of these features will impact your day-to-day programming life and whether Java's concurrency journey is actually over now that these features have become available or if there are",What are the challenges posed by the increase in thread count with the introduction of virtual threads in Java?
